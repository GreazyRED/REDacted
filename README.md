# REDacted

REDacted is a modern Swift implementation of the Gazelle framework. 

The aim of this project is to impelement all official API's as well as quality of life features such as 2FA, Free Leech Tokens, etc that
are not supported by the API.

This code base is optimized for Xcode 10 and Swift 4.2 (if not completely v4.2 yet, it will be).

This project uses Cocoapods for framework integration. Don't forget to "pod install" and open the workspace file.

BEWARE: The code base right now is VERY volatile. Fork and modify this code base at your own risk or if you're the type of masochist that enjoys merge conflicts :D
